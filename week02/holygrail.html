            <p>Akwa Ibom State, the “Land of Promise” is Nigeria’s 21st State. It was created on 23rd September, 1987 by the Military Administration of General Ibrahim Babangida after years of prolonged struggle by the people who occupied the mainland part of the former Cross River State.

                The Ibibio Union, formed in 1928, had transformed from a mere cultural association to a goal driven institution by 1948, thus championing and promoting the cause of state creation in Nigeria.
